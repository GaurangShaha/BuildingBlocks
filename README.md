# BuildingBlocks Library

The BuildingBlocks Library is a collection of foundational modules designed to streamline Android application development. It offers a suite of tools and components that address various aspects of app development, promoting code reuse and consistency across projects.

## Modules Overview

The library encompasses the following modules:

1. **Foundation**: Provides essential base classes and utilities that serve as the building blocks for other modules. You can find the detailed documentation of it [here](https://gaurangshaha.github.io/BuildingBlocks/foundation/index.html).

2. **Networking**: Facilitates network operations, offering tools for API interactions, data fetching, and network-related utilities. You can find the detailed documentation of it [here](https://gaurangshaha.github.io/BuildingBlocks/networking/index.html).

3. **Test Common**: Contains testing utilities and base classes to support unit and integration testing, ensuring code reliability and robustness. You can find the detailed documentation of it [here](https://gaurangshaha.github.io/BuildingBlocks/test-common/index.html).

4. **UI Common**: Offers building blocks user interface components and helpers to maintain a consistent look and feel across applications. You can find the detailed documentation of it [here](https://gaurangshaha.github.io/BuildingBlocks/ui-common/index.html).

5. **UI Component**: Includes a set of customizable UI elements and widgets that can be readily integrated into applications to enhance user experience. You can find the detailed documentation of it [here](https://gaurangshaha.github.io/BuildingBlocks/ui-component/index.html).
