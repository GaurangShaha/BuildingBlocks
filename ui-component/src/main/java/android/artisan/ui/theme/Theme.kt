/**
 *  The light color palette for the application.
 *
 *  This palette defines the colors used in the light theme of the application,
 *  including primary, secondary, background, and surface colors, as well as
 *  their "on" colors (colors used for content displayed on top of them).
 *
 *  - `primary`: The primary color of the theme, used for key elements like the
 *    app bar. In this case, it's a lighter shade of black.
 *  - `primaryVariant`: A variant of the primary color, typically used for
 *    status bars or other elements that need a slightly different shade of the
 *    primary color. Here, it's pure black.
 *  - `secondary`: The secondary color, used for less prominent UI elements.
 *    Here, it's a lighter shade of white.
 *  - `secondaryVariant`: A variant of the secondary color, potentially used
 *    for emphasizing certain secondary elements. Here, it's pure white.
 *  - `background`: The color used for the background of screens. Here, it's a
 *    grey color.
 *  - `surface`: The color used for surfaces, such as cards or sheets. Here, it's
 *    the same grey color as the background.
 *  - `onPrimary`: The color used for content displayed on top of the primary
 *    color. Here, it's white.
 *  - `onSecondary`: The color used for content displayed on top of the
 *    secondary color. Here, it's black.
 *  - `onBackground`: The color used for content displayed on top of the
 *    background color. Here, it's black.
 *  - `onSurface`: The color used for content displayed on top of surfaces.
 *    Here, it's black.
 *  - `error`: The color used for error states, such as */
